How it works?

- accepts a starting URL and a destination directory;
- download the page of the URL fetched;
- save it in the destination directory;
- recursively proceed to any valid links in this URL;
- should correctly handle being interrupted by Ctrl-C;
- perform work in parallel where reasonable;
- support resume functionality by checking the destination directory for downloaded pages;
- skip downloading and processing where not necessary
 provide "happy-path" test coverage () (missing)
- be implemented in Go;
